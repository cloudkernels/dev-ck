At CloudKernels, we experiment with various levels of the systems software
stack for lightweight, secure, and high-performant workload execution in
distributed environments. This blog is mostly to share our findings.  We are
particularly interested in virtualization technologies, hypervisors, and
unikernels.

Our goal is to understand the sources of overhead in each part of the systems
stack on both x86 and ARM architectures. Additionally, we explore potential
benefits from stripping down OS / runtime dependencies from generic application
execution stacks. 

Feel free to [contact us][1] for comments, [tweet][2] to us about an
interesting read, [fire up issues][3] on the github page, pull requests etc.
