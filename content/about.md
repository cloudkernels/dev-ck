We are a team of engineers & software developers, experimenting with various
levels of the systems software stack. Our passion is to understand how things
work! 

We work on building software that allows lightweight, secure, and
high-performant workload execution in distributed environments. 

This space is mostly to share our findings. We are particularly interested in
virtualization technologies, hypervisors, containers, and unikernels.

Our goal is to understand the sources of overhead in each part of the systems
stack on modern architectures (x86, ARMv7/ARMv8, RISC-V etc.). We also explore
potential benefits from stripping down OS / runtime dependencies from generic
application execution stacks. 

Feel free to [contact us][1] for comments, [tweet][2] to us about an
interesting read, [fire up issues][3] on the github page, pull requests etc.
