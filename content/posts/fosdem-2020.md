Earlier this month we visited [FOSDEM][1], an absolutely open and free event
for developers, open-source vendors and enthusiasts to meet, share their ideas
and news, and discuss the latest in open source. Talks at FOSDEM are usually
organized within several sections: Keynotes, Main tracks, Developer rooms and
Lightning talks.

Some people from our team had visited before, but for most of us first timers
it was really exciting. Packed keynotes, busy dev rooms, people chatting
outside, over coffee, beer, or snacks!

The conference was held in [ULB Solbosch Campus][2], a very old, but also very
modern student campus. The conference itself is free entry, without any
registration necessary, so naturally, everyone interested can easily attend.
Regarding food and drink at FOSDEM, there are few coffee shops inside the
campus, and there's always a few stands there serving coffee, beer,
sausages, fries, and of course, Belgian waffles of all flavors, shapes and
sizes.

We attended a couple of [main][3] track [talks][4] and [keynotes][5] which we
found super interesting, but our heart belongs to the devrooms :D We were
overwhelmed by the diversity of topics covered, especially with regards to
containers, their ecosystem and related technologies: [Container][6] devroom,
[SDN][7] or [SDS][8] devrooms, [Microkernels][9] or [Virtualization][10].
During the sessions, as well as during the breaks and evenings we had the
opportunity to chat with intersting people, working on exciting projects.

Our contribution to FOSDEM this year was a [talk][11] on lighweight
virtualization, focusing on a simple hypervisor we've crafted, and our
upstreaming effort for running Amazon's [Firecracker][12] on a Rapsberry Pi 4.
People found it quite interesting, and we're glad it stimulated insightful
discussions for feedback, as well as next steps.

The event was quite big; attendees were estimated to be 5500 this year, whereas
last year they were estimated to be around 6000. Network traffic statistics are
available [here][13] and a detailed analysis [here][14]. 

All in all it was a great experience, we loved talking to people about
interesting projects, and we are super excited to showcase some of the things
we've got piled up for next year! Brussels is a fun place to be, let alone the
fine beer available from local and international breweries!

Looking forward to FOSDEM 2021!
